Install Monit

First, install Monit on your AlmaLinux 8 system:

# Run the command below:

dnf install monit -y

2. Configure Monit for Varnish

Next, create a configuration file for Varnish in the Monit configuration directory.
Step 1: Create a Configuration File

Create a file named varnish in the Monit configuration directory:

# Run the command below:

touch /etc/monit.d/varnish

Step 2: Add Configuration to Monitor Varnish

Edit the varnish configuration file to include the following:

# Run the command below:

# Example content of /etc/monit.d/varnish
check process varnish with pidfile /var/run/varnishd.pid
    start program = "/usr/bin/systemctl start varnish"
    stop program = "/usr/bin/systemctl stop varnish"
    if failed host 127.0.0.1 port 80 protocol http
        then alert
    if 5 restarts within 5 cycles then timeout
    alert youremail@example.com

This configuration does the following:

    Monitors the Varnish process using its PID file.
    Defines commands to start and stop Varnish.
    Checks if Varnish is responding on port 80.
    Sends an alert if Varnish is not responding.
    Sends an alert if Varnish restarts 5 times within 5 cycles.
    Sends alerts to the specified email address.

3. Configure Monit for Email Alerts

To ensure Monit can send email alerts, configure the email settings in the main Monit configuration file /etc/monitrc.

Add or modify the following lines:

# Run the command below:

set mailserver smtp.example.com port 587
    username "your-email@example.com" password "your-email-password"
    using tlsv1 with timeout 30 seconds

set alert youremail@example.com

Replace smtp.example.com, your-email@example.com, and your-email-password with your actual SMTP server details and credentials.
4. Enable and Start Monit

Enable and start the Monit service to apply your configurations:

# Run the command below:

systemctl enable monit
systemctl start monit

5. Test the Configuration

You can test the configuration by simulating a Varnish failure:

    Stop the Varnish service:

    # Run the command below:

systemctl stop varnish

Check the Monit status:

# Run the command below:

    monit status

    Monit should detect that Varnish is down and attempt to restart it, sending an alert if configured correctly.

6. Verify Email Alerts

Ensure your email settings are correct and that you receive alerts. You can send a test alert from Monit using:

# Run the command below:

monit reload
monit send alert

With these steps, Monit will monitor your Varnish cache and alert you to any issues early, allowing you to take action before they become critical.
